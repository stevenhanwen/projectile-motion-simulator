# projectile-motion-simulator
A Java program that can be run to simulate projectile motion for basic physics applications. In this program, you can enter the height, angle, and speed of the launch. A basic visualization will show up, which provides the max height, time of flight, final speed, and the angle to the ground of the final velocity.
